# KFuzzTest Bridge

This program serves as a bridge between a random input generator, and KFuzzTest.

## Usage (TODO)

Given a description to an expected structure for a KFuzzTest target, patches
the "fuzzable" data from a random source.

For example, given the following C structure hierarchy:

```c
struct foo {
    u32 a;
    struct bar *b;
};

struct bar {
    struct data *d;
};

struct data {
    char arr[42];
};
```

A user may describe as:

```sh
./kfuzztest-bridge \
    "foo { u32 ptr[bar] } bar { ptr[data] } data { arr[u8, 42]}" \
    "my-fuzz-target" random-blob.bin
```

Where `"my-fuzz-target"` is the name of the KFuzzTest target, and 
`random-blob.bin` is a random blob, e.g., generated by AFL.

## Textual Input Format

KFuzzTest uses a region-based encoding in its input format. This is described
in detail in the [initial RFC](https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250813133812.926145-1-ethan.w.s.graham@gmail.com/).
